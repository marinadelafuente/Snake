![Appearance](https://github.com/marinadelafuente/Snake/blob/master/docs/assets/images/Snake-game.jpg)

To remember older times where having a Nokia 3310 was all you wished for, I have developed the phone's signature game in a modernized retro version for computers. 

Use the ↑ ← ↓ → in your computer to move the snake and eat the apples to earn points.

- Developed with HTML, SASS and JavaScript.
